    "text": "Growing up in California’s San Joaquin Valley, surrounded by agriculture and mountainous landscapes, I decided to pursue a career as an environmental scientist and ecologist. I’m extremely passionate about environmental protection and I love being in nature, studying different aspects that make various natural environments so unique. I am also an artist, using my skills to draw different plants, insects, and natural landscapes that I have seen and studied. As a researcher, I am fascinated by plants and insects. I have applied for PhD programs after my graduation, focused on conservation ecology."
